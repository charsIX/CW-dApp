# CWdApp

This is my initial log.txt about Smart Contracts development. During this last year of experience with DeFi, I've finally chosen The Internet of Blockchains, [COSMOS](https://github.com/cosmos). This love for the cosmos led me to [CosmWasm](https://github.com/CosmWasm) specifically to the [cw-template](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template.git) repository.
